            Hanfu, whose full name is "Han nationality's traditional costume", also known as hanyiguan, Hanzhuang and Huafu, is a unique Han nationality's style and character formed through natural evolution from the Yellow Emperor's accession to the throne to the middle of the 17th century (late Ming and early Qing Dynasty) in the main residential areas of the Han nationality, with "Huaxia Han" culture as the background and leading ideology, and Chinese etiquette culture as the center His nation's traditional clothing and accessories system is the embodiment of China's "state of clothes", "state of etiquette", "Splendid China" and "state of sailis".

            Hanfu is made of two feet and two inches (about 50cm) wide cloth [37], which is divided into collar, skirt, lapel, Jin, train, sleeve, skirt, belt and Fu [38]. Take two pieces of cloth of the same length, fold them in half as the front and back, and sew the back seam. No Lapel at the front is a straight collar and double breasted garment. If you take another piece of cloth, cut it into two lapels and sew it on the left and right lapels, it is the right Lapel with oblique collar. The middle seam of the front and back train is called "Li [39], that is, Du Meridian and Ren meridian. The Ren is on the right side of Ren meridian, so it is called right Ren. The length of train is divided into waist, knee and foot. According to the length of the train, there are three kinds of Hanfu: Ru [40], Li [41], Shenyi [42]. The seam between the sleeve and the train is called Xi [43], and the cuff is called Qu [44]. A complete set of Hanfu usually has three layers: underwear, tunic and overcoat.

            Hanfu consists of clothes, first clothes, hair styles, face decorations, shoes and accessories. It condenses the outstanding crafts and aesthetics of Chinese culture, such as textile, batik, Jiaxie and Jinxiu. It inherits more than 30 intangible cultural heritages of China, and embodies the reputation of beautiful China, the country of clothes and the country of rites.

            Since the Yellow Emperor, there have been mainly two kinds of cloth in Hanfu: Ramie and silk [45], which are collectively known as cloth [46], which are respectively controlled by Dianqi and Diansi [47], and the ramie for making kudzu cloth is collected by Zhangge. Gebu, also known as Xiabu, is a kind of cloth for mourning, sacrificial and deep clothes [48-49]. The fineness of summer cloth is called silk. In summer, they wear Ge Ma Saro, and in winter, they use silk and cotton to fill the flocs, so they are called Dong Mian Xia Ge, Xia Sha Dong crepe. By the Eastern Han Dynasty, cotton spinning and weaving began to rise in Hainan and Yunnan [51]. According to the textile technology, warp and weft organization, cloth can be divided into brocade, silk, silk, yarn, silk, silk, crepe, silk, satin and so on. In the Qin and Han Dynasties, besides Qi Wan and Lu Hao, there were also some famous products such as Wu Ling, Yue Luo, Chu silk and Shu brocade. Later, the Northern Song Dynasty set up a "silk brocade courtyard" in Tokyo, which recruited many Sichuan brocade weavers to make gowns for nobles, thus forming the song brocade. When Nanjing was the capital of Ming Dynasty, Yunjin came into being. Zhijin, brocade, Luo and Ling are the most expensive fabrics [52], which are made of green Luo clothes, red Luo clothes and red Luo covering knees. The round collar robes and official clothes are all made of silk. The back and chest of the official dress are made of the most exquisite brocade.
