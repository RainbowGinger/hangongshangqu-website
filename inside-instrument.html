            In ancient times, Cuan was a kind of wind instrument made of clay. It was round or oval and had six holes. Cuan originated from the labor and production activities of the Han ancestors. At first, it may be made by the ancestors to imitate the calls of birds and animals, so as to trap prey. Later, with the progress of society, it evolved into a simple musical instrument, and gradually increased the number of musical holes, and developed into a melodic musical instrument that can play tunes.

            Flute is one of the most distinctive wind instruments in China. In May 1986, 16 vertical bone Flutes (made from the bones of birds) were excavated from the early Neolithic site in Jiahu village, Wuyang County, Henan Province. According to the measurement, they have a history of more than 8000 years. In vertical blowing, the sound holes range from five to eight, most of which are seven hole flutes, which have roughly the same scale as the Chinese tradition we are familiar with.

It is generally believed that today's huqin developed from Xiqin and has become a unique string instrument in China. It is not only suitable for the expression of deep, sad content, but also can describe the magnificent artistic conception.
            Erhu is one of the main bowstring instruments in the family of Chinese musical instruments. The word huqin appeared in the Tang Dynasty.

After Yuan Dynasty and Ming and Qing Dynasties, huqin became the general name of string wiping instrument.
